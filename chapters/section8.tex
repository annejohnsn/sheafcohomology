8.1 Let X be connected and locally simply connected, and choose a base point $x_0$. Show that for any locally constant sheaf (of sets) $A$, the group $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ acts on the stalk $A_{x_0}$. Show that this gives a functor $A \mapsto A_{x_0}$ which is an equivalence of categories between the category of locally constant sheaves on $X$ and the category of sets with a $\pi_1(X,x_0)$-action. \\

Let $X$ be connected and locally simply connected and fix $x_0$ in $X$. Let $p:[0,1] \rightarrow X$ be a loop in $X$ based at $x_0$. Then since $A$ is a locally constant sheaf, $p$ lifts uniquely to a loop $\tilde{p}$ in $EtA$ for each $germ_{x_0}(s)$ in the stalk of $A$ at $x_0$, that is, in  $\pi^{-1}(x_0)$, the fiber of $x_0$. Since homotopies also lift to homotopies, two homotopic paths $p_1$ and $p_2$ lift to homotopic maps $\tilde{p_1}$ and $\tilde{p_2}$ in $EtA$, so that $\tilde{p_1}(1)=germ_{x_0}(s)=\tilde{p_2}(1)$. Then we can define an action of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ on $A_{x_0}=\pi^{-1}(x_0)$ by $p \cdot s = \tilde{p}_s(1)$, where $p$ is a loop based at $x_0$, $s$ is in the fiber of $x_0$ (ie $s$ in the stalk of $A_{x_0}$) and $\tilde{p}_s$ is the unique lift of $p$ for $s$ implied by the fact that $\pi$ is a covering map. Note that if $e$ is the constant loop, then $\tilde{p}_s(1) = s$, $\forall s$ so that $e \cdot s = \tilde{p}_s(1)=s$
