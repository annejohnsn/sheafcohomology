1(a)  You have the correct space; can you just give the abelian group structure on the space in terms of the group multiplication and unit(s)? What you write is not entirely clear to me, and once you write down the groups structure, you may agree that there are better ways to say this.\\

1(b) is fine, but do read my comments.\\

2(a)  I just added what I would have liked to see as final conclusions os that things becomes easier for the next part. Also, for any map $f:E \rightarrow X$, the presheaf of sections is always a sheaf. The associated etale space won't be homeomorphic to E though if f wasn't etale.\\

2(b) just fix the case x=0 at the end\\

3.  I corrected your associated sheaf: if you don't have enough amalgamations, you need to add them in order to get a sheaf, but in your case, the problem was that you had too many amalgamations. In that case you need to identify them. In order to see this, you would need to think a bit more about the germs at a point x in X. I indicated how you can think about that. See whether this makes sense.
You can redo the unit map on the next page. Your construction was correct, so just calculate what the result is in this case.\\

4(i).  I don't think you had realized what the map gamma really is. This is where you miss the point set topology course. I should have given you a bit more of a picture with it.I have now drawn the picture in the margin. The idea is that you map the real line  to the circle by  sending each interval [a,a+1) 1-1 to the circle and then just keep repeating so as a fiber bundle it looks like a spiral.With the image and info added, have another look at this problem. You really need to keep this image in mind; otherwise you can make mistakes with the algebra.So redo this...\\

5. I will still send you my feedback on the rest of question 5 as well, but that part was OK, so you won't need to work on it. 5(c) is OK.\\

6. complete your proof that these two sheaves are not the same, by showing that something is in one and not in the other.
