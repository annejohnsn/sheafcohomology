Let $(M, \rho)$ be an ultrametric space and let $\mathcal{T}$ be the toplogy induced on $M$ by $\rho$. Suppose $(M, \mu, \mathcal{B}_M)$ is a measurable space (note that in an ultrametric space, $\mathcal{B}_M$, the Borel $\sigma$-alegra, is the same as $\mathcal{T}$). 

\begin{theorem}
Let $(M, \mu, \mathcal{B}_M)$ be a measurable ultrametric space, as above. Let $\Omega$ be the set $\Omega = \{\mu(A) \mid A \subseteq M\}$. Then $\Omega$ is a discrete subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\leq 0}$.   
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $a \in \Omega$ and let $A \subseteq M$ be such that $\mu(A)=a$. 	
\end{proof}
