8.1 Let X be connected and locally simply connected, and choose a base point $x_0$. Show that for any locally constant sheaf (of sets) $A$, the group $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ acts on the stalk $A_{x_0}$. Show that this gives a functor $A \mapsto A_{x_0}$ which is an equivalence of categories between the category of locally constant sheaves on $X$ and the category of sets with a $\pi_1(X,x_0)$-action.

8.2 Prove the following: let $S^d$ be a $d$-dimensional sphere. For any Abelian group $A$, 
\[
H^n(S^d;A)= \begin{cases} A & \text{when } n=0 \text{ or } n=d \text{ provided } d \neq 0 \\ A \oplus A & \text{when } d =n=0;\\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
